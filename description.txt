  ~ excelsior ~ 

Excelsior is a mod who's focus is to expand on what we feel is missing from the base game, while exploring our very own ideas as well. 
So far, we have added 3 new bosses, for the Ice, Meteorite/Space, & Mushroom biomes, aswell as minor content updates to the frost legion, sandstorms, meteorites(again), and space.

We also have a new class : The Cleric Class.  Cleric's have the choice between Radiance, who focus on healing and supporting other players; and Necrotic, who focus on dealing damage using life instead of mana.
Please note that the Cleric Class is most likely very buggy right now.  If you have any questions/concerns about it, please message me.


List of Major content in the mod : 
- New class : Cleric Class
- 3 new bosses 
- 1 new town npc
- 50+ new weapons
- 10+ new healing tools
- 10 new armor sets
- 10+ new accessories
- new worldgen
